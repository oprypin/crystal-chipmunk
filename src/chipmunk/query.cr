  # Fast collision filtering type that is used to determine if two objects collide before calling
  # collision or query callbacks.
  #
  # Chipmunk has two primary means of ignoring collisions: groups and
  # category masks.
  #
  # Groups are used to ignore collisions between parts on a complex object. A
  # ragdoll is a good example. When jointing an arm onto the torso, you'll
  # want them to allow them to overlap. Groups allow you to do exactly that.
  # Shapes that have the same group don't generate collisions. So by placing
  # all of the shapes in a ragdoll in the same group, you'll prevent it from
  # colliding against other parts of itself.
  #
  # Category masks allow you to mark which categories an object belongs to
  # and which categories it collides with. By default, objects exist in
  # every category and collide with every category.
  #
  # The type of categories and mask in `ShapeFilter` is `UInt32`.
  #
  # There is one last way of filtering collisions using collision handlers.
  # See the section on callbacks for more information. Collision handlers can
  # be more flexible, but can be slower. Fast collision filtering rejects
  # collisions before running the expensive collision detection code, so
  # using groups or category masks is preferred.
  struct ShapeFilter
    alias Group = LibC::SizeT
    alias Bitmask = UInt32

    # Value signifying that a shape is in no group.
    NO_GROUP = Group.new(0)

    # Value for signifying that a shape is in every category.
    ALL_CATEGORIES = ~Bitmask.new(0)

    # Collision filter value for a shape that will collide with anything except `NONE`.
    ALL = new(NO_GROUP, ALL_CATEGORIES, ALL_CATEGORIES)
    # Collision filter value for a shape that does not collide with anything.
    NONE = new(NO_GROUP, ~ALL_CATEGORIES, ~ALL_CATEGORIES)

    # Two objects with the same non-zero group value do not collide.
    #
    # This is generally used to group objects in a composite object together to disable self collisions.
    getter group : Group
    setter group : Group
    # A bitmask of user definable categories that this object belongs to.
    #
    # The category/mask combinations of both objects in a collision must agree for a collision to occur.
    getter categories : Bitmask
    setter categories : Bitmask
    # A bitmask of user definable category types that this object object collides with.
    #
    # The category/mask combinations of both objects in a collision must agree for a collision to occur.
