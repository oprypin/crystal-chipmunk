  # Chipmunk's rigid body type.
  #
  # Rigid bodies hold the physical properties of an object like its mass, and position and
  # velocity of its center of gravity. They don't have an shape on their own.
  # They are given a shape by creating collision shapes (`Shape`) that point to the body.
  #
  # Use forces to modify the rigid bodies if possible. This is likely to be
  # the most stable.
  #
  # Modifying a body's velocity shouldn't necessarily be avoided, but
  # applying large changes can cause strange results in the simulation.
  # Experiment freely, but be warned.
  #
  # Don't modify a body's position every step unless you really know what
  # you are doing. Otherwise you're likely to get the position/velocity badly
  # out of sync.

      # A dynamic body is one that is affected by gravity, forces, and collisions.
      # This is the default body type.
      DYNAMIC
      # A kinematic body is an infinite mass, user controlled body that is not affected
      # by gravity, forces or collisions. Instead the body only moves based on its velocity.
      # Dynamic bodies collide normally with kinematic bodies, though the kinematic body
      # will be unaffected. Collisions between two kinematic bodies, or a kinematic body
      # and a static body produce collision callbacks, but no collision response.
      KINEMATIC
      # A static body is a body that never (or rarely) moves. If you move a static body,
      # you must call one of the `Space` reindex functions.
      # Chipmunk uses this information to optimize the collision detection.

    # There are two ways to set up a dynamic body. The easiest option is to

    # density of each collision shape added to the body. Chipmunk will
    # automatically calculate the mass, moment of inertia, and center of
    # gravity for you. This is probably preferred in most cases.
    #
    # The other option is to set the mass of the body when it's created,
    # and leave the mass of the shapes added to it as 0.0. This approach is
    # more flexible, but is not as easy to use. Don't set the mass of both
